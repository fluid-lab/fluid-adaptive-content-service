## Instructions to run the service locally
**Step 1 - Clone the Repository**\
**Step 2 - Install the required node modules**\
Run
```
npm install
```
**Step 3 - Setting API keys for services that require it**\
Currently, only *Oxford* is the service being used that requires API keys. You can create an account on [their site](https://developer.oxforddictionaries.com/) and acquire your free *API ID* and *API KEY* from there.
After acquiring the Id and Key, create a `.env` file looking like this
```
OXFORD_APP_ID=your_api_id_goes_here
OXFORD_APP_KEY=your_api_key_goes_here
```
**Step 4 - Start the service server**\
When at the root of the repository, run
```
npm start
```
When the server starts, it is ready to accept requests at the available endpoints.
